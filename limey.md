# reformed Loki (limey)

After a great deal of experimentation toiling in the Loki laboratory, I have learned that a Loki does have an ideal form, and this can be referred to as either the reformed Loki or the limey Loki.

....if youre reading this then probably you are a bartender at a well equipped bar.  You are strongly encouraged to add your own personal style and touch to the loki.  Rules:


### hard rules
* no sweet
* no vermouth

### the base drink
* 10 oz or larger glass
* Fill the glass entirely with ice
* Add the Juice of one half lime, and a small amount of olive brine
* Gin (any of these)
  * Monkey 47
  * Tanqueray original
  * The Botanist should be added until the glass is full
* serve the Loki with three olives and a pickle

### custom

You are the bartender and I am the software engineer.  Be as creative as youd like to!
